# Customer-Personality-Analysis-ML

## Abstract
In today’s data-driven world, understanding customer behavior is essential for businesses to design effective marketing strategies. This project focuses on Customer Personality Analysis using machine learning techniques on a Kaggle dataset. The main objective is to analyze customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and lifestyle attributes to identify meaningful customer segments.

Unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering are applied to group customers based on similarities, while PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and better visualization. The dataset includes features such as income, education, spending habits, and campaign responses.

The results of this project help businesses improve targeted marketing, customer retention, and decision-making by identifying valuable customer groups.

## Project Description
An Unsupervised Learning project to segment customers using K-Means and PCA.

# Strategic Customer Personality Analysis via Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project is a production-ready Flask application that performs customer segmentation on the Kaggle **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, K-Means clustering, elbow and silhouette-based cluster selection, PCA visualization, and business-friendly cluster insights.

## Features

- Modular ML pipeline for loading, preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and insight generation
- Feature engineering for age, customer tenure, family size, spending, purchases, and engagement
- Automated cluster selection using both Elbow Method heuristics and Silhouette Score
- PCA visualization for two-dimensional exploration of discovered customer segments
- Flask UI for dataset upload, default dataset usage, charts, segment labels, and preview table
- Deployment-ready structure for Render and Azure App Service

## Dataset

1. Download the Kaggle **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset.
2. Place the file at `data/marketing_campaign.csv`.
3. If your downloaded file is tab-separated, keep the `.csv` extension or upload it through the web app.

Expected columns include fields such as `Year_Birth`, `Education`, `Marital_Status`, `Income`, `Kidhome`, `Teenhome`, purchase counts, spend columns, campaign response columns, and `Dt_Customer`.

## Local Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Standardizes column names and handles mixed CSV/TSV input
- Converts `Dt_Customer` into customer tenure in days
- Derives customer age from `Year_Birth`
- Builds `Children_Count`, `Total_Spending`, `Total_Purchases`, `Campaign_Engagement`, and `Average_Order_Value`
- Applies median imputation and scaling to numeric columns
- Applies frequent-value imputation and one-hot encoding to categorical columns

### 2. Clustering

- Evaluates K-Means from 2 to 8 clusters
- Tracks inertia for elbow-style analysis
- Tracks silhouette scores for cluster quality
- Selects an `optimal_k` using a blended elbow and silhouette heuristic

### 3. PCA Visualization

- Reduces the transformed feature space to two principal components
- Produces a cluster scatter plot for easy interpretation

### 4. Business Insights

- Labels each cluster using spending, income, campaign responsiveness, and family composition
- Generates concise actions for marketing and customer strategy teams

## Deployment

### Render

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new **Web Service** on Render.
3. Set:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start command: `gunicorn app:app`
4. Add the Kaggle dataset to `data/marketing_campaign.csv` before deploy, or use upload in the UI.

### Azure App Service

1. Create a Python Web App in Azure App Service.
2. Configure the startup command as:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

3. Deploy the project using GitHub Actions, ZIP deploy, or Local Git.
4. Ensure the dataset is packaged with the app or uploaded through the interface.

## Notes for Production

- Replace `SECRET_KEY` in `app/config.py` with an environment-backed secret.
- Add persistent storage if you want uploaded datasets and generated plots to survive restarts.
- For large-scale usage, store artifacts in Azure Blob Storage or an S3-compatible bucket.
